Look here, im no big genius but i found how to do this.

This is EaglerLauncher, a eaglercraft launcher with the most updated versions and clients.

**Q&A**

*This is missing X client!*
Fork the project, add the client and then make a pull request

*Dang, your css abilities are a pile of trash!*
Shut up, if you're that good just fork and pull request

*WARNING*
This is not made by me
Obviously i dont have the name of everyone who made the clients, just keep in mind it wasnt me!
